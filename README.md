# particulate-matter-predict

To compare several deep learning methods by comparing the predicted resutls in several areas in Seoul

There are five models are compared

* CNN(Convolutional neural network) model
* LSTM(Long short term neural network) model
* GRU(Gated recurrent neural network) model
* ConvNet+GRU model
* ConvNet+LSTM model

source code:
* data_visualization.ipynb  Preview the columns of collected data
* LSTM.ipynb  Example of one predicting model 
* Model Comparison.ipynb  of all trained models

For more descriptiion, please check the pdf paper

models are running on jupyter notebook 2.0 and written in python language

* necessary libraries 
* matplotlib
* numpy
* tensorflow-gru
- keras
