# particulate-matter-predict

To compare several deep learning methods by comparing the predicted resutls in several areas in Seoul

There are five models are compared

* CNN(Convolutional neural network) model
* LSTM(Long short term neural network) model
* GRU(Gated recurrent neural network) model
* ConvNet+GRU model
* ConvNet+LSTM model

source code contains example of one predicting model and comparison of all trained models

models are running on jupyter notebook 2.0 and written in python language

necessary libraries 
matplotlib
numpy
tensorflow-gru
keras
